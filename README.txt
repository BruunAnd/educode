The language is designed as a response to the lack of intermediary languages between simple and more complicated languages, which previously has hindered the learning process of newcomers to programming.

During the development of EduCode, it was discovered that object-oriented programming as well as gamification served to ease the understanding and learnability of several programming concepts, especially for adolescents.

Minecraft was chosen as the platform for the programming language and so, through Minecraft, EduCode became a way to code entities and affect the game environment within the world of Minecraft, with the purpose of learning programming concepts and computational thinking.
